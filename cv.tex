\noindent I have experience in QA Software Testing (Manual and Automation). In Cybersecurity, I have experience in discovering, documenting, and reporting two
major security flaws of both national and international websites (see \textit{Working Experience}). Technology, programming, and software development has always been my life-long passion.
On the sideline, I also promote the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Open Science.
